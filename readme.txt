Her presentation is complete EXCEPT on how to set Grunt up. Since she released the tutorial, the installation steps have changed. 

Steps to set up the build:
1.) Install node.js from the website, install the binary installer. 
2.) open up a command line and navigate to the project base (that this readme.txt file exists in)
3.) type in the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file. 
4.) Remove the content HTML and Javascript in the src/index.html and src/js/workspace.js to use your own code. 
5.) Specify what the name of your project is. 


Other commands you can use:
- "grunt spell" This will check your spelling in your javascript and html files.
